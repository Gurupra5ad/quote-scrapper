30 DAY Challenge - DAY 10

As a part of day 10 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge,I am going to code a autonomous web scrapper which when given a site name and what to search exactly will automatically extract the data and give it to us. This in future will be integrated with machine learning and deep learning to have more extended workbase of automation.
